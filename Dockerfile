# Gevent needs gcc, make, file, ffi
RUN apk update && apk add gcc musl-dev make file libffi-dev
# create a non-root user.  Only really needed in stage 2,
# however this makes the copying easier and straighttforward;
# pip option --user doesn't do the same thing if run as root

# Speed hack; we install gevent before a1 because when building repeatedly (eg during dev)
# and only changing a1 code, we do not need to keep compiling gevent which takes forever
