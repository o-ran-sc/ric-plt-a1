# This builds an image for A1 based on ubuntu. The build takes between three and four
# minutes depending on what was previously cached, and results in an image that is
# roughly 260 MiB in size (as of May 2021)

# upgrade pip as root
RUN pip install --upgrade pip

# pick up things for gevent build
#
RUN    apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y gcc musl-dev make file libffi-dev g++

# --- all root operations must be above this line ------------------------------------


# create a simple user.  This is only really needed in stage 2,
# however this makes the copying easier and straighttforward;
# the 'pip option --user' command  doesn't do the same thing when
# run as root.
#
RUN addgroup a1user && adduser --ingroup a1user a1user

# switch to the non-root user for installing python things
USER a1user

# Speed hack; we install gevent before a1 because when building repeatedly (eg during dev)
# and only changing a1 code, we do not need to keep compiling gevent which takes forever
RUN pip install --user gevent
COPY setup.py /home/a1user/
COPY a1/ /home/a1user/a1
RUN pip install --user /home/a1user



# ----- stage 2  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# It might be tempting to use python:3.8, but that image is more than
# 800 GiB to start, and the final image size if it is used is over
# 1 GiB!!  Using the plain ubuntu image, then installing py3, and taking
# things built in the first stage, the final image size is less than 300 MiB.
