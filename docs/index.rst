A1 Mediator
===========

API
===

You can see the API (OpenAPI3 spec) at ``a1/openapi.yml``. You can also
see the “pretty” version if you run the container at
``http://localhost:10000/ui/``.

Running
=======

Optional ENV Variables
----------------------

You can set the following ENVs to change the A1 behavior:

1. ``RMR_RETRY_TIMES``: the number of times failed rmr operations such as timeouts and send failures should be retried before A1 gives up and returns a 503. The default is ``4``.

2. ``INSTANCE_CREATE_ACK_TIMEOUT``: Please refer to the delete flowchart in docs/; this is ``T1`` there. The default is 5 (seconds).

3. ``INSTANCE_DELETE_ACK_TIMEOUT``: Please refer to the delete flowchart in docs/; this is ``T2`` there. The default is 5 (seconds).


K8S
---
The "real" helm chart for A1 is in the LF it/dep repo. That repo holds all of the helm charts for the RIC platform. There is a helm chart in `integration_tests` here for running the integration tests as discussed above.
