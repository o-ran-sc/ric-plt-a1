All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on `Keep a Changelog <http://keepachangelog.com/>`__
and this project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`__.

[1.0.0] - TBD

::

    * Release 1.0.0 will be the Release A version of A1


[0.12.1] - 9/20/2019
::
    * switch to rmr 1.8.1 to pick up a non blocking variant of rmr that deals with bad routing tables (no hanging connections / blocking calls)
    * improve test receiver to behave with this setup
    * add integration test for this case
    * this also switches past 1.5.x, which included another change that altered the behavior of rts; deal with this with a change to a1s helmchart that causes the sourceid to be set to a1s service name, which was not needed prior
    * improve integration tests overall


[0.12.0] - 9/19/2019
::

    * Implement type PUT
    * Implement type GET
    * Remove RIC manifest
    * Read type GET to get schema for instance PUT
    * Remove Utils (no longer needed)
    * lots more tests (unit and integration)

[0.11.0] - 9/17/2019

::

    * This is on the road to release 1.0.0. It is not meant to be tested (E2E) as it's own release
    * Implement the Release A spec in the openapi.yaml
    * Rework A1 to follow that spec
    * Remove rmr_mapping now that we use policyid as the mtype to send and a well known mtype for the ACKs
    * Add the delay receiver test to the tavern integration tests
    * Remove unneeded ENV variables from helm charts
    * Switch away from builder images to avoid quicksand; upgrade rmr at our own pace


[0.10.3] - 8/20/2019

::

    * Update to later rmr-python
    * Add docs about upgrading rmr
    * remove bombarder since tavern runs apache bench


[0.10.2] - 8/14/2019

::

    * Update to later rmr-python

[0.10.1] - 8/9/2019

::

    * Greatly reduce the size of A1 docker from 1.25GB to ~278MB.
    * Add a seperate dockerfile for unit testing


[0.10.0] - 7/30/2019

::

   * Rename all /ric/ URLs to be consistent with requirements of /a1-p/


[0.9.0] - 7/22/2019
-------------------

::

   * Implement the GET on policies
   * Add a new endpoint for healthcheck. NOTE, it has been decided by oran architecture documents that this policy interface should be named a1-p in all URLS. In a future release the existing URLs will be renamed (existing URLs were not changed in this release).


[0.8.4] - 7/16/2019
-------------------

::

   * Fix the 400, which was in the API, but wasn't actually implemented
   * Update the test fixture manifests to reflect the latest adm control, paves way for next feature coming which is a policy GET



[0.8.3] - 6/18/2019
-------------------

::

   * Use base Docker with NNG version 1.1.1



[0.8.2] - 6/5/2019
-------------------

::

   * Upgrade RMR due to a bug that was preventing rmr from init in kubernetes



[0.8.1] - 5/31/2019
-------------------

::

   * Run unit tests as part of docker build



[0.8.0] - 5/28/2019
-------------------

::

   * Convert docs to appropriate format
   * Move rmr string to int mapping to a file



[0.7.2] - 5/24/2019
-------------------

::

   * Use tavern to test the actual running docker container
   * Restructures the integration tests to run as a single tox command
   * Re-ogranizes the README and splits out the Developers guide, which is not needed by users.

.. _section-1:

[0.7.1] - 5/23/2019
-------------------

::

   * Adds a defense mechanism against A1 getting queue-overflowed with messages A1 doesnt care about; A1 now ignores all incoming messages it's not waiting for, so it's queue size should now always be "tiny", i.e., never exceeding the number of valid requests it's waiting for ACKs back for
   * Adds a test "bombarding" script that tests this

.. _section-2:

[0.7.0] - 5/22/19
-----------------

::

   * Main purpose of this change is to fix a potential race condition where A1 sends out M1 expecting ACK1, and while waiting for ACK1, sends out M2 expecting ACK2, but gets back ACK2, ACK1. Prior to this change, A1 may have eaten ACK2 and never fufilled the ACK1 request.
   * Fix a bug in the unit tests (found using a fresh container with no RIC manifest!)
   * Fix a (critical) bug in a1rmr due to a rename in the last iteration (RMR_ERR_RMR_RCV_RETRY_INTERVAL)
   * Make unit tests faster by setting envs in tox
   * Move to the now publically available rmr-python
   * Return a 400 if am xapp does not expect a body, but the PUT provides one
   * Adds a new test policy to the example RIC manifest and a new delayed receiver to test the aformentiond race condition

.. _section-3:

[0.6.0]
-------

::

   * Upgrade to rmr 0.10.0
   * Fix bad api spec RE GET
   * Fix a (big) bug where transactionid wasn't being checked, which wouldn't have worked on sending two policies to the same downstream policy handler

.. _section-4:

[0.5.1] - 5/13/2019
-------------------

::

   * Rip some testing structures out of here that should have been in rmr (those are now in rmr 0.9.0, upgrade to that)
   * Run Python BLACK for formatting

.. _section-5:

[0.5.0] - 5/10/2019
-------------------

::

   * Fix a blocking execution bug by moving from rmr's timeout to a non blocking call + retry loop + asyncronous sleep
   * Changes the ENV RMR_RCV_TIMEOUT to RMR_RCV_RETRY_INTERVAL

.. _section-6:

[0.4.0] - 5/9.2019
------------------

::

   * Update to rmr 0.8.3
   * Change 503 to 504 for the case where downstream does not reply, per recommendation
   * Add a 502 with different reasons if the xapp replies but with a bad/malformed/missing status
   * Make testing much more modular, in anticipating of moving some unit test functionality into rmr itself

.. _section-7:
