Optional ENV Variables
----------------------

You can set the following ENVs to change the A1 behavior:

1. ``A1_RMR_RETRY_TIMES``: the number of times failed rmr operations such as timeouts and send failures should be retried before A1 gives up and returns a 503. The default is ``4``.

2. ``INSTANCE_DELETE_NO_RESP_TTL``: Please refer to the delete flowchart in docs/; this is ``T1`` there. The default is 5 (seconds). Basically, the number of seconds that a1 waits to remove an instance from the database after a delete is called in the case that no downstream apps responded.

3. ``INSTANCE_DELETE_RESP_TTL``: Please refer to the delete flowchart in docs/; this is ``T2`` there. The default is 5 (seconds). Basically, the number of seconds that a1 waits to remove an instance from the database after a delete is called in the case that downstream apps responded.

The "real" helm chart for A1 is in the LF it/dep repo. That repo holds all of the helm charts for the RIC platform. There is a helm chart in `integration_tests` here for running the integration tests as discussed above.

Local Docker
-------------

Build the image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   docker build --no-cache -t a1:latest .

.. _running-1:

Start the container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample RMR routing table is supplied here in file `local.rt` for mounting as a volume:

::

   docker run -p 10000:10000 -v /path/to/local.rt:/opt/route/local.rt a1:latest

View container API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A web user interface generated from the OpenAPI specification can be accessed at this URL:

::
    http://docker-host-name-or-ip:10000/ui

Check container health
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command requests the container health.  This requires a Storage Data Layer
(SDL) service; expect internal server error if that service is not available/running.

::

    curl localhost:10000/a1-p/healthcheck
