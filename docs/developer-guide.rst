Version bumping
===============

This project follows semver. When changes are made, the versions are in:

1) ``docs/release-notes.rst``

2) ``setup.py``

3) ``ci/container-tag.yaml``

4) ``a1/openapi.yml``

Running locally
===============

1. This requires that RMR is installed on the base system. (the
   ci/Dockerfile does this when running in Docker)

2. It also requires rmr-python >= 0.10.1 installed. (The dockerfile also
   does this)

3. Create a ``local.rt`` file and copy it into ``/opt/route/local.rt``.
   Note, the example one in ``local_tests`` will need to be modified for
   your scenario and machine.

4. Copy a ric manifest into ``/opt/ricmanifest.json`` and an rmr mapping
   table into ``/opt/rmr_string_int_mapping.txt``. You can use the test
   ones packaged if you want:

   ::

     cp tests/fixtures/ricmanifest.json /opt/ricmanifest.json cp
     tests/fixtures/rmr_string_int_mapping.txt
     /opt/rmr_string_int_mapping.txt

5. Then:

   sudo pip install –ignore-installed .; set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   /usr/local/lib/; set -x RMR_SEED_RT /opt/route/local.rt ; set -x
   RMR_RCV_RETRY_INTERVAL 500; set -x RMR_RETRY_TIMES 10;
   /usr/bin/run.py

Testing locally
===============

There are also two test receivers in ``localtests`` you can run locally.
The first is meant to be used with the ``control_admission`` policy
(that comes in test fixture ric manifest):

::

   set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib/; set -x RMR_SEED_RT /opt/route/local.rt ; python receiver.py

The second can be used against the ``test_policy`` policy to test the
async nature of A1, and to test race conditions. You can start it with
several env variables as follows:

::

   set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib/; set -x RMR_SEED_RT /opt/route/local.rt ; set -x TEST_RCV_PORT 4563; set -x TEST_RCV_RETURN_MINT 10001; set -x TEST_RCV_SEC_DELAY 5; set -x TEST_RCV_RETURN_PAYLOAD '{"ACK_FROM": "DELAYED_TEST", "status": "SUCCESS"}' ; python receiver.py

To test the async nature of A1, trigger a call to ``test_policy``, which
will target the delayed receicer, then immediately call
``control_admission``. The ``control_admission`` policy return should be
returned immediately, whereas the ``test_policy`` should return after
about ``TEST_RCV_SEC_DELAY 5``. The ``test_policy`` should not block A1
while it is sleeping, and both responses should be correct.

::

   curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' localhost:10000/ric/policies/test_policy
   curl -v -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"dc_admission_start_time": "10:00:00", "dc_admission_end_time": "11:00:00"}' localhost:10000/ric/policies/control_admission_time

Finally, there is a test “bombarder” that will flood A1 with messages
with good message types but bad transaction IDs, to test A1’s resilience
against queue-overflow attacks

::

   set -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib/; set -x RMR_SEED_RT /opt/route/local.rt ;  python bombard.py
