Policy Overview
===============
There are two "object types" associated with policy: policy types and policy instances.

Policy types define the name, description, and most importantly the schema of all instances of that type. Think of policy types as defining a JSON schema for the messages sent from A1 down to xapps.

Xapps do not receive policy types from A1, types are used only by A1 to validate instance creation requests from north of the RIC. However, xapps must register for instances of type ids in their xapp descriptor.

Xapp developers can also create new policy types if they invent new policies; the exact process of where these are stored is still TBD. For practical purposes, when the RIC is running, a CURL needs to be send from somewhere to load the type.

Policy instances are concrete instantiations of a policy type. They give concrete values of a policy. There may be many instances of a single type. Whenever a policy instance is created in A1, messages are sent over RMR to all xapps registered for that policy type; see below.

Xapps can "sign up" for multiple policy types using their xapp descriptor.

Xapps are expected to handle multiple simultaneous instances of each type that they are registered for.

Xapps supporting A1


Integrating Xapps with A1
=========================

A1 to Xapps
-----------
See https://rancodev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RICPLT/pages/60784719/RIC+message+types

When A1 sends a message to xapps, the schema for messages from A1 to the xapp is defined here: https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=ric-plt/a1.git;a=blob;f=a1/openapi.yaml;h=fed4b77546264cc8a390504dae725ca15060d81a;hb=97f5cc3e3d42e1525af61560d01c4a824b0b2ad9#l324

All policy instance requests get sent from A1 using message 20010

Xapps to A1
-----------
There are three scenarios in which Xapps are to send a message to A1:

1. When an xapp recieves a CREATE or UPDATE message for a policy instance. Xapps must respond to these requests by sending a message of type 20011 to A1. The schema for that message is here: https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/gitweb?p=ric-plt/a1.git;a=blob;f=a1/openapi.yaml;h=fed4b77546264cc8a390504dae725ca15060d81a;hb=97f5cc3e3d42e1525af61560d01c4a824b0b2ad9#l358
2. Since policy instances can "deprecate" other instances, there are times when xapps need to asyncronously tell A1 that a policy is no longer active. Same message type and schema. The only difference between case 1 and 2 is that case 1 is a "reply" and case 2 is "unsolicited".
3. Xapps can request A1 to re-send all instances of a type using a query, message 20012. When A1 recieves this (TBD HERE, STILL BE WORKED OUT)
