      "message": "Well it turns out that there are a few things missing and/or different in the ubuntu world.  Specifically, A1 requires a component which forces 3.8, and the default \u0027python\u0027 is 2.x.\n\nSo, I\u0027ve uploaded a patch set that ensures 3.8 is installed, along with a component which is missing with the base install, and hard reference python in the command string rather than relying on the #! that pip adds to the a1-run wrapper.  \n\nSorry that I missed this; not a python programmer and just assumed python was python.",
