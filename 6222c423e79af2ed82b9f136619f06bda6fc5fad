      "message": "suggestion for Timo: It would be REALLLY helpful if pysdl came with a \"standalone\" backend that uses a dict like this, for the purposes of testing. That would help all clients patch SDL in their unit tests, rather than having to re-invent the wheel like this. \n\nIt could be instantiated like SyncStorage(backend\u003dstandalonetest) or something like that. \n\nJust a suggestion for SDL itself.",
